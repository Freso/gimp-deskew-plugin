v1.1, 2014-10-27, Alexandre Prokoudine

Changes:

- Deskew has been relocated to 'Layer -> Transform' menu 
- Newer plugin template code 
- Support for more recent versions of automake 
- A few i18n fixes
- The code fixed to use GIMP 2.8 API
- The build system fixed to properly install the plugin's
  executable file

Note that in this version cubic interpolation is harcoded. 
In the future, it might be a good idea to turn this into a 
GEGL op that would ask the user to choose a particular 
sampler. Patches are welcome.
